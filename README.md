# Fitness tracker

I wanted a way to measure my overall fitness. That's where I thought a single metric to indicate my fitness level at any time would be most useful. It needs to be based on exercises that can be measured and not subjective. The key exercises I landed on were:
- bench press
- overhead press
- pull ups
- squat
- 5km run

These exercises cover the vast majority of muscles in the human body. The 5KM time is also a reasonable measurement for the cardiovascular system. 

Data sources for reference points:
- Bench press: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/bench-press
- Overhead press: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/shoulder-press
- Pull ups: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/pull-ups
- Squat: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/squat
- Running: https://runninglevel.com/running-times/5k-times#google_vignette

The current aim is to get to intermediate stage for my age band.
TODO: I'd like to make this tool generic for others. Right now, the targets are hard coded for me.
